A student tracking system must give 
actionable information on each 
student's engagement with a college, 
at any stage of development and 
throughout time. Any ideal vision, 
whether acceptable or not, is still far 
from present practice in most
institutions. Many are in the process of 
evolving in response to changing 
internal and external circumstances.
The enrollment approach enables new 
technologies to emerge and the benefits 
of tracking to be demonstrated. 
Enrollment can be sped faster by having 
information (for example, from a 
previous inquiry) already accessible post 
documentation that can be optically 
marked, allowing students to enroll at 
computer terminals or remotely through 
phone or email, or transforming a 
portion of an enrollment document into 
some type of identity card.
Any system for storing data about a 
particular individual is enhanced by 
some type of "unique identification 
number" that can link all bits of 
information to that person. This might 
be an enrolment number at a campus. 
Tracking would be improved in a 
computerized system if there was a 
means to identify all actions involving a 
student.
Everyone now has a National Insurance 
number and other numbers, such as 
passports or driving licenses, but there 
has been considerable controversy 
regarding the ramifications, particularly 
in terms of civil rights, of providing 
pupils with a unique and permanent 
number.
